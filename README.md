# Investigation-of-the-police-budgets

This paper explores the police budgets within the Toronto community and how the budgets within the police
departments are distributed. In this paper, graphs including tables and histograms will be used to visualize
the data, while multiple linear regression will be used to investigate the influence of different uses of police
budgets as well as give predictions for expected budgets. These findings will provide insights for the police
departments on the planning of the allocation of their budgets.
